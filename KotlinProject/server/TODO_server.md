#   Routing

##   HIGH PRIORITY: Communicate on writing sample data into the local DB
    Will the frontend or backend write the entry inserts?
    What should be implemented for efficient dev + testing (e.g util methods for insert, wipe)?

##   Modify /server to meet frontend needs
    Potential tasks:
    *   Implement additional fields and methods for Trip, Event (e.g Location type with latitude, longitude...)
    *   Implement owner User and collaborator Users for a particular Trip


#   Map view

##   Roughly understand frontend architecture + app flow to write according to their needs
    Don't find out quietly. Ask.




#   Session persistence
    This is of secondary priority. Not now.

#   External OAuth services
    This is of... like... tertiary priority. Definitely not now. No questions will be entertained.
