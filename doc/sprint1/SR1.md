**As any traveller, if I have many Trips I want an easy way to sort them. \[SCRUM-52\]**

1. Given I have many trips, when I use search or sorting, then results update instantly without reloading the page.  
2. I should be able to sort by, start date, end date, number of events and location.

**As any traveler I want to manage events in my trip overview(create, read, update, delete, and reorder) so my plans stay accurate. \[SCRUM-53\]**

1. Given valid event details, when I save, then the event appears at the correct chronological position.  
2. Given I open an event, then full details (title, time, location, notes) are displayed.  
3. Given I delete an event, then it is removed from the itinerary after confirmation.  
4. Given I hold-and-drag and reorder events, then the new order is saved and synced for all members.

**As any traveller should be able to adjust my trip in case of new circumstances. \[SCRUM-54\]**

1. Given I am in Trip View, I should be able to alter the trip’s duration.  
2. I should be able to alter the header image for a trip.

**As a traveler, I want to create and delete trips so I can plan effectively. \[SCRUM-25\]**
1. Given I am in the Home View, I can see the add trip button.
2. Given I tapped the add trip button, I will be prompted to fill out basic information about the trip.
3. Given I put in valid data, I can create the trip and start adding events.
   
1. Given I am in the Home View, I can see the delete trip button.
2. Given I confirm I wish to delete the trip, it is deleted.


These will be moved to the next sprint:
