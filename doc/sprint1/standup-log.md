**Mon Oct 20 \- Sprint 1 \- Standup 1**

The group has somewhat studied the documentations of Kotlin and Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), including how to write a Compose Multiplatform app.


The upcoming task would be to clarify how to document the release plan and the sprint, with assistance from the professor.


The above task is set to be finished by Wednesday this week.


The group needs the professor’s feedback in order to continue the above task.



**Mon Oct 27 \- Sprint 1 \- Standup 2**

The group has not managed to progress on the app.


The upcoming tasks are to continue documenting the CRC cards and make progress on the sprint’s assigned user stories.


The above tasks are set to be finished by the end of the sprint.


The main struggle is the group’s lack of knowledge on Compose Multiplatform and how to write the components of the app.



**Mon Nov 3rd \- Sprint 1 Standup 3**

Since the previous meeting, the user stories for this Sprint have been partially fulfilled:

- The frontend interfaces of the account creation and login views  
- The scaffold for all pages and the navigation bar  
- The frontend of the trip list has been completed (without the sorting feature)  
- The frontend of the user invitation feature in the trip view  
- Each trip's events are separated by day

Additionally, the system design document for the current app has been completed.


The incomplete user stories assigned in this Sprint will be moved to Sprint 2\.


The main blocker was the incomplete backend, which hindered the development of responsive features.
