**Team Organization:**  
We assigned the following roles to ourselves:

- Klodiana \- PM  
- Andrew \- UI/Frontend  
- Aakash \- AI  
- Tony \- Backend  
- Kai \- Backend

We have organized ourselves using Jira and Discord.

**Decision making**  
We made decisions in a collaborative and flexible way, where we spontaneously made small decisions over text correspondence. Large decisions were made during meetings, after fruitful discussion. 

**Prioritizing user stories**  
We prioritised user stories that:

- Were prerequisites for future features.  
- That we were interested in.  
- That were feasible.

It took us around two to three hours to decide upon user stories and assign them to everyone. 

**Meetings**  
For meetings, we have:

- Decided the itinerary beforehand.  
- Followed said itinerary.  
- Split into multiple breakout rooms, when we had multiple tasks to do.

	  
Over the course of Sprint 0, we have met once to twice a week. We tried to keep our meetings around one hour long.

**Next phase**  
In the next phase of the project, we should:

- Have meetings earlier and more often.  
- Set smaller deadlines before future meetings.  
- Clearly explain expectations prior to meetings.  
- Tightly organize meetings to maximize time dedicated to discussion.
