# Navi

**Navi** is a Kotlin-based platform that helps users plan, organize, and share trips collaboratively.  
Users can create detailed itineraries, manage events, vote on plans, and receive intelligent suggestions for nearby activities and travel optimizations.

# Installation

KMP allows Navi to work on multiple platforms, the currently working ones are the following:

### Android
To build and run the development version of the Android app, use the run configuration from the run widget in your IDE’s toolbar or build it directly from the terminal:

on macOS/Linux

```./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug```

on Windows

```.\gradlew.bat :composeApp:assembleDebug```

### JVM
Note: Only works with Java 21

To build and run the development version of the desktop app, use the run configuration from the run widget in your IDE’s toolbar or run it directly from the terminal:

on macOS/Linux

```./gradlew :composeApp:run```

on Windows

```.\gradlew.bat :composeApp:run```
